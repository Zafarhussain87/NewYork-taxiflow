# NewYork-taxiflow
Network analysis of taxi flow in New York using public taxi dataset

Our dataset contains the duration of taxi trips, regions travelled, coordinates of the source and destination,
and distance covered along the date and time. The objective of this project is to analyze factors that affect
demand for taxis, we will explore issues like the most common pickup, drop-off locations, temporal traffic
patterns and congested regions. We will apply tools and technologies covered in the course to find answers
to the above-mentioned questions or more. Currently we plan to model regions as nodes and taxi flow as
edges, in order to represent time, we can further divide a day into 6 time slots such that each region will be
represented by 6 different nodes for each time slot.
